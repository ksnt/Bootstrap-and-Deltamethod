# Reference
You can easily find useful information about Bootstrapping and Delta method from sites such as links below. I recommend Efron's articles and books regarding Bootstrap such as "The Jackknife,the Bootstrap and Other Resampling Plans". As for Delta method, I think some books on econometrics and mathematical statistics are useful.
