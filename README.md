## Reference
You can easily find useful information about Bootstrapping and Delta method from sites such as links below. I recommend Efron's articles and books regarding Bootstrap such as **"The Jackknife,the Bootstrap and Other Resampling Plans" by Bradley Efron**. As for Delta method, I think some books on econometrics and mathematical statistics are useful; for example, you can find in a manuscript titled **["Econometrics" by Bruce E. Hansen](http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/econometrics/)**. The article is free.
