# Reference
You can easily find useful information about Bootstrapping and Delta method from sites such as links below. I recommend Efron's articles and books regarding Bootstrap such as **"The Jackknife,the Bootstrap and Other Resampling Plans"**. As for Delta method, I think some books on econometrics and mathematical statistics are useful; for example, you can find in a manuscript titled **"Econometrics" by Bruce E. Hansen**. The article is free.
